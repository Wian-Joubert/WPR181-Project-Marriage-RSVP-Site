            <h1>Meet</h1>
            <p>(As told by Mary) Our love story started well before either of us were actually born. Our fathers became fast and dear friends as young working professionals in Cape Town, and fatherhood came at a similar time for them. That's when James and I entered the story. Growing up, our families went on countless trips to Table Mountain, the beach , and various wineries together. On our trips, James's sister, Hannah and I bonded the most. This lead to years long friendship to this day. I always remember thinking, Oh, James is cute, but we grew up in different suburbs, went to different schools, and lived very different lives. I never thought I guy like him would fall for someone like me. There was no way our paths would ever cross "like that," until they did.</p>

            <h1>First Date</h1>
            <p>My uncle Ben was getting married—to one of my mom's other best friend's daughters, believe it or not—and I needed a date to the wedding. I happened to be on vacation with my mom and James's mom. It was one night she casually said, Oh, just go with Jamie. He's already going to be there, and he'll definitely dance with you and tell you look breathtaking. He would be honored to go with you. I think she said to much. This stirred around in my head for a while. I started to develop a small crush on him just after hearing these simple words. Seems everything worked out perfectly.Uncle Ben's wedding was the first night we truly got to enjoy each other not on a family vacation or around a dinner table. We started to goof around, causing trouble(laughing at each other during formal speeches.) This is when I saw another side of Jamie. The fun, child-like Jamie, not just the handsome, mysterious guy. Sparks flew, but we kept them a secret knowing it could be chaos if things crumbled, so we took the time to make sure we were both all in before telling our families. Everything worked out as it was meant to. We hope our story will inspire others to laugh at our wedding. Life is to short to wait for better days.</p>

            <h1>Adventures</h1>
            <p>James and I went on various adventures together. First that comes to mind is our camping trip in the Drakensberg. James loves camping with all his heart. I HATE it. James convinced me to join him and a few friends. We slept in a cave edging near a waterfall. It turned out to be quite fun. We stayed up late sharing stories around the camp fire and that's when the chaos happened. We all went for a night swim in the freezing waters of KZN. Although we got sick a week later, we made memories that we will cherish till the day we die.</p>

            <h1>Proposal</h1>
            <p>It was warm summers evening. We went on vacation to Mauritius with our parents for the December holiday. As usual we went for our daily sunset walks along side the beautiful beach. Everything was just perfect. We made a friend during or time there, Dobby. Dobby was a dog. We never knew where he came from but when reached the resting benches Dobby would sit there, wagging his tail waiting for us. On our last day there we went for our walk, but this time it was DIFFERENT. Dobby was wearing a collar. As I looked at the tag, there the words where, “Will you marry me?” and James behind on is knee.</p>
